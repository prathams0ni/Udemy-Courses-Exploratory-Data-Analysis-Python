# Data Pre Processing & Exploratory Data Analysis Using a Udemy Course Analysis Data Set.

## Udemy Course Analysis:

This project provides an in-depth analysis of Udemy course data to uncover meaningful trends, insights, and patterns from the online learning landscape.  
The notebook explores various aspects such as pricing strategies, subject popularity, subscriber trends, and content types to understand what drives success on the Udemy platform.

## Project Overview:

The **Udemy Course Analysis** project focuses on exploring and visualizing data from a dataset containing information about multiple Udemy courses.  
The main goal is to analyze how different factors — like price, subject, course level, and publication date — affect the number of subscribers and course performance.

This analysis can help:
- **Learners** identify valuable courses and learning trends  
- **Instructors** understand what types of courses attract more students  
- **Businesses** gain insights into e-learning market behavior

## Objectives:

1. **Data Exploration:** Understand the structure, size, and features of the Udemy dataset.  
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, inconsistent entries, and format issues.  
3. **Statistical Analysis:** Study relationships among variables such as price, subscribers, and subject.  
4. **Visualization:** Use charts and graphs to represent trends and distributions.  
5. **Insights & Conclusions:** Summarize findings to reveal what makes a course successful.

## Dataset Information:

The dataset includes the following key columns:
- **Course Title** — Name of the Udemy course  
- **Subject** — The category/subject of the course (e.g., Business, Web Development, etc.)  
- **Price** — Course price (Free or Paid)  
- **Number of Subscribers** — Total learners enrolled  
- **Number of Reviews** — Feedback count  
- **Level** — Difficulty level (Beginner, Intermediate, Expert, All Levels)  
- **Content Duration** — Total hours of video content  
- **Published Timestamp** — Date when the course was released  

---

## Key Analysis and Insights:

- **Subject Popularity:** Identified which subjects attract the most students.  
- **Free vs. Paid Courses:** Compared enrollment patterns between free and paid courses.  
- **Course Level Trends:** Examined how course difficulty affects subscriber count.  
- **Pricing Analysis:** Explored correlations between price, ratings, and reviews.  
- **Publication Trends:** Visualized how course creation has evolved over time.  
- **Subscriber Behavior:** Found which features most influence course popularity.  

---

## Visualizations:

The notebook includes multiple graphical representations such as:
- Bar charts for course distribution by subject  
- Box plots comparing price vs. subscribers  
- Heatmaps showing correlation between numerical features  
- Line charts showing course publishing trends  
- Scatter plots for price vs. reviews/subscribers

## Conclusion:

This project demonstrates how data analysis can uncover trends in online education and help decision-makers — from individual instructors to e-learning platforms — make data-driven improvements.
It provides a solid foundation for understanding what factors contribute to a successful Udemy course.
